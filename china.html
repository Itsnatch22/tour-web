            The Great Wall of China is an ancient series of walls and fortifications, totaling over 13,000 miles, originally built to protect Chinese states and empires from invaders. It stretches from **Liaoning Province** to **Gansu Province**, winding through mountains, deserts, and plains. Tourists often visit the **Mutianyu** and **Badaling sections**, which are known for their beautiful scenery and easy access.
